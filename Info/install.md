# Installation of Cactus

Installing Cactus is easy. First, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ShearOfDoom/CactusReborn.git

Next, move to the top-level CactusReborn directory, containing the `CactusReborn`, and `Info` folders. Next, install using the `python` command:

    python ./CactusReborn/setup.py install

Cactus should be installed on your system after this. If this doesn't properly add Cactus to your `PYTHONPATH`, try manually adding it through the command line.
