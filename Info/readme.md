# About

Cactus is a game engine written in Python, used to create text-based console games, similar to Zork. This engine is still in it's early stages, but will hopefully be updated often.

# Contributing

The Cactus project more or less follows the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. We do have a few changes to it though.

- We use `self` in classes instead of `cls`.
- We always use double quotes.
- We **always** use docstrings in classes/methods. The only exceptions to this rule are "magic methods" like `__init__`, or `__add__`. Your docstrings should always be detailed and descriptive.
- Your code should **always** be written clearly, and well.

# Legal Information
