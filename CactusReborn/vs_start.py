"""
vs-start.py

This is just a small helper file, to ensure that the
project will actually build and run in Visual Studio.
This file will not be included in the releases. This
is also where tests of the library will be performed.

FYI: I'm choosing to be explicity with the name
references, but in reality you only need to prefix
class/function names with "cactus".
